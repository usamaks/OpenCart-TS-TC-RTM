# OpenCart-TS-TC-RTM

This document provides information on the testing process for OpenCart, including test scenarios, test cases, and the requirements traceability matrix (RTM).

## Test Scenario

A test scenario is a high-level description of a feature or functionality to be tested. It is typically written in non-technical language and serves as a basis for creating more detailed test cases. Test scenarios for OpenCart may include:

   1. User registration
   2. Product search
   3. Cart management
   4. Checkout process
   5. Payment integration
   6. Shipping calculation

## Test Case

A test case is a detailed step-by-step procedure for testing a specific aspect of the software. It should include inputs, expected results, and actual results. Test cases are created based on test scenarios and are designed to ensure that each scenario is thoroughly tested.


## Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

The requirements traceability matrix (RTM) is a document that links each requirement to the corresponding test scenario and test case. It ensures that all requirements have been tested and that all tests are necessary to validate the requirements. An example RTM for OpenCart is provided below:
|Requirement	    | Test Scenario	   |Test Case  |
| --------------- | :---------------:| ---------:|
|User registration|	User registration|Test Case 1|
|Product search	  | Product search	 |Test Case 2|
|Cart management	|Cart management	 |Test Case 3|
|Checkout process	|Checkout process	 |Test Case |
